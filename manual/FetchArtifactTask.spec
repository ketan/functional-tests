* Verify task "2" is "Fetch Artifact" task without on cancel and properties "Pipeline Name: ${runtime_name:basic-pipeline-fast}, Stage Name: defaultStage, Job Name: defaultJob, Source File: source_file, Destination: dest_dir" that runs if state is "Passed"

* For pipeline "downstream-pipeline"
* Verify "fetchartifact" task with attributes "@pipeline: ${runtime_name:basic-pipeline-fast}, @stage: defaultStage, @job: defaultJob, @srcfile: source_file, @dest: dest_dir" exists for "defaultJob" in "defaultStage"

* Open task "2"

* Verify task "2" is "Fetch Artifact" task without on cancel and properties "Pipeline Name: ${runtime_name:basic-pipeline-fast}, Stage Name: defaultStage, Job Name: defaultJob, Source Directory: source_dir, Destination: dest_dir2" that runs if state is "Passed"

* For pipeline "downstream-pipeline"
* Verify "fetchartifact" task with attributes "@pipeline: ${runtime_name:basic-pipeline-fast}, @stage: defaultStage, @job: defaultJob, @srcdir: source_dir, @dest: dest_dir2" exists for "defaultJob" in "defaultStage"

* Open new task form "Fetch Artifact"

AutoComplete and Save
* Set "task[pipelineName](text_field): b" - Already on Task edit popup
* Auto complete should show up "${runtime_name:basic-pipeline-fast}" - Already on Task edit popup
* Select option "${runtime_name:basic-pipeline-fast}" - Already on Task edit popup
* Set "task[stage](text_field): d" - Already on Task edit popup
* Auto complete should show up "defaultStage" for textBox "1"
* Select option from suggestion at index "0" for text box "1"
* Set "task[job](text_field): d" - Already on Task edit popup
* Auto complete should show up "defaultJob" for textBox "2"
* Select option from suggestion at index "0" for text box "2"
