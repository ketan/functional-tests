FanInOffBehavior
================

Setup of contexts
* Fanin configuration - setup
* Using pipeline "C1, C2, C3, C4-auto-new, C5" - setup
* With "2" live agents in directory "StageDetails" - setup
* Capture go state "FanInOffBehavior" - setup

FanInOffBehavior
----------------

tags: diamond dependency, fanin, auto, server_restart_needed


* With material "git-one" for pipeline "C1"
* Checkin file "new-file-2" as user "go <go@po.com>" with message "Added new-file 2"
* Remember current version as "git-one-g2"


* With material "git-two" for pipeline "C1"
* Checkin file "new-file-2" as user "go <go@po.com>" with message "Added new-file 2"
